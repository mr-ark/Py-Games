# In general, for a given grid of width N, we can find out check if a N*N â€“ 1
# puzzle is solvable or not by following below simple rules : 
 
# 1. If N is odd, then puzzle instance is solvable if number of inversions
#	 is even in the input state.
# 2. If N is even, puzzle instance is solvable if 
#	 * the blank is on an even row counting from the bottom
#	   (second-last, fourth-last, etc.) and number of inversions is odd.
#    * the blank is on an odd row counting from the bottom
#       (last, third-last, fifth-last, etc.) and number of inversions is even.
# For all other cases, the puzzle instance is not solvable.
